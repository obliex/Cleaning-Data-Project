## The script
THe R script in this project folder read data from the test and training subjects. Readings are provided separately from the subject tags and activity types. Hence the three data sets have to combined to create one clean data set. Further, the test and the traning data sets also have to be combined to creaate the overall data set. This is what the script does

In addition, the script also creates an aggregate data set of means summarized by subject and activity.
